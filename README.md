Multi-modul maven project with inheritance

The idea is to show a project with moduls and inheritance. There are 4 subprojects/moduls: 
-project-one, 
-project-two, 
-dependency-management, 
-plugin-management

Dependency-management inherits plugin-management; project-one Ð¸ project-two both inherit dependency-management.
